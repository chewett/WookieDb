WookieDb
========

A python wrapper to deal with MySQL databases more nicely. This will provide
 a level of abstraction so that dict objects can be passed to a variety of
 different statements so it reduces the amount of time needed to write sql
 by using functions to create the sql for you.

This uses MySQL-python which can be installed on fedora using

`yum install MySQL-python`
